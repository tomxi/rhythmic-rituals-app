    "target_user": "Academic researcher specializing in ML and Music (music structure analysis)",
    "original_requirements": "Create a personalized, AI-guided productivity portal to drastically improve productivity and facilitate better research. Address two core pain points: 1) Sporadic idea capture requiring instant, effortless capture with timestamps and tags, and 2) Task prioritization struggles needing a clear single highest-priority task recommendation. Implement 'Rhythm & Rituals' model with Projects ‚Üí Milestones ‚Üí Tasks hierarchy, emphasizing participatory design and MVP-first approach."

# Productivity Portal PRD

## Language & Project Information
- **Language**: English
- **Programming Language**: Python,  JavaScript
- **Project Name**: productivity_portal
- **Target User**: Academic researcher specializing in ML and Music (music structure analysis)
- **Original Requirements**: Create a personalized, AI-guided productivity portal to drastically improve productivity and facilitate better research. Address two core pain points: 1) Sporadic idea capture requiring instant, effortless capture with timestamps and tags, and 2) Task prioritization struggles needing a clear single highest-priority task recommendation. Implement 'Rhythm & Rituals' model with Projects ‚Üí Milestones ‚Üí Tasks hierarchy, emphasizing participatory design and MVP-first approach.


## Product Definition

### Product Goals

1. **Eliminate Cognitive Overhead Through Zero-Friction Capture**: Provide instant, effortless capture of sporadic ideas, insights, achievements, and pain points without interrupting deep work flow state, implementing the 'Immutable Log' pattern for comprehensive thought tracking.

2. **Optimize Decision Making with AI-Guided Priority**: Present the single highest-priority task at any moment through intelligent recommendation system, directly answering 'What should I work on right now?' to eliminate choice paralysis and ensure concrete progress.

3. **Enable Structured Flexibility Through Rhythm & Rituals**: Support the milestone-driven cadence (Projects ‚Üí Milestones ‚Üí Tasks) with 2-3 week cycles, balancing deadline-driven structure with creative research flexibility while incorporating AI-guided 'Knowledge Harvest' rituals for synthesis.

### User Stories

1. **As an ML/Music researcher**, I want to instantly dump any sporadic thought, idea, achievement, or pain point into a zero-friction timestamped input field so that I can maintain my deep work flow state without losing critical insights or observations.

2. **As an easily distracted academic**, I want to see a single, AI-recommended highest-priority task prominently displayed that directly answers "What should I work on right now?" so that I can make concrete progress without decision paralysis.

3. **As a deadline-driven researcher**, I want to organize my work using the Projects (üèÜ) ‚Üí Milestones (üìç) ‚Üí Tasks (‚úÖ) hierarchy with 2-3 week milestone cycles so that I can balance structured deadlines with creative research flexibility.

4. **As a participatory design advocate**, I want the system to continuously adapt to my specific workflow patterns through iterative feedback loops so that the tool evolves with my needs rather than constraining my productivity.

5. **As a knowledge synthesis researcher**, I want AI-guided 'Knowledge Harvest' rituals at milestone completion to help me transform raw captured data from my Immutable Log into durable insights that inform future research directions.
